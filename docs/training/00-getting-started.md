## First Login

When your department administrator creates your account, you will receive a welcome email with your login credentials. Your initial password is temporary and must be changed on first login.

1. Open your browser and navigate to your department's Logbook URL.
2. Enter the **username** and **password** provided to you.
3. Click **Sign In**.

> _[Screenshot of the login page showing the username and password fields, the Sign In button, and the "Forgot Password?" link at the bottom]_

> **Hint:** If you did not receive a welcome email, contact your department's IT Manager or the person who set up the system. They can resend your credentials or reset your password from the admin panel.

## Changing Your Password

After your first login, you will be prompted to change your temporary password. Your new password must meet the department's security policy.

1. Enter your **current (temporary) password**.
2. Enter your **new password** twice to confirm.
3. Click **Change Password**.

> **Screenshot placeholder:**
> _[Screenshot of the change password form showing the current password field, new password field, confirm password field, and any password requirements displayed (length, complexity)]_

**Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters (your department may require more)
- Cannot reuse recent passwords
- Session will time out after a period of inactivity (configured by your department)

> **Troubleshooting:** If your password change fails, ensure it meets all displayed requirements. If you are locked out after too many failed attempts, wait for the lockout period to expire or contact your administrator.

## Understanding the Interface

The Logbook uses a sidebar navigation layout. The main areas of the screen are:

1. **Sidebar (Left)** - Navigation menu for all modules
2. **Main Content Area (Center)** - The active page you are working on
3. **Header/Breadcrumb (Top)** - Shows your current location and provides context actions

> **Screenshot placeholder:**

## Navigation Sidebar

The sidebar is organized into sections based on your role. Not all sections are visible to every member -- what you see depends on your assigned positions and permissions.

- **Sign Out** - Log out of the system

> **Note:** My Account is accessible to all users and is separate from the Organization Settings, which are only visible to administrators.

## Your Dashboard

The dashboard is your landing page after login. It provides an at-a-glance view of what matters most:

- **Quick Stats** - Total members, active members, upcoming events, training completion rates
- **Upcoming Events** - The next few scheduled events
- **Upcoming Shifts** - Your next assigned shifts
- **Recent Activity** - Latest actions across the department
- **Notifications** - Unread alerts and reminders

> **Screenshot placeholder:**
> _[Screenshot of the dashboard showing the stats cards at the top, the upcoming events panel, upcoming shifts panel, and the recent activity feed below]_

> **Hint:** The dashboard is personalized. Officers and administrators see additional summary cards with department-wide metrics. Regular members see their own upcoming items and assignments.

---

## Account Settings

To update your personal settings, click **My Account** in the sidebar. This takes you to `/account`, which is separate from the organization settings.

From here you can:

- Update your **email** and **phone number**
- Set your **notification preferences** (email, event reminders, training alerts)
- Change your **password**
- View your **assigned roles and permissions**

> **Screenshot placeholder:**
> _[Screenshot of the Account Settings page showing the profile section, notification preferences toggles, and the change password section]_

## Getting Help

- **Forgot your password?** Use the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page. You will receive a reset link by email.
- **Locked out?** Wait for the lockout period to expire, or ask your IT Manager to unlock your account.
- **Missing a module?** Some modules may be disabled by your department. Contact your administrator to enable them.
- **Permission denied?** If you see a "Not Authorized" message, the action requires a role you have not been assigned. Contact your officer or IT Manager.
- **Something looks wrong?** Your department may have an error monitoring dashboard (Settings > Error Monitor) where administrators can review issues.
