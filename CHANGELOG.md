## [Unreleased]

### Added - Frontend (2026-02-08)

#### Onboarding UX Improvements
- **Unsaved Changes Warning**: Added `useUnsavedChanges` and `useFormChanged` hooks to prevent accidental data loss during navigation
  - Warns before browser refresh/close with unsaved changes
  - Blocks in-app navigation with confirmation dialog
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/hooks/useUnsavedChanges.ts`

- **Password Requirements Always Visible**: Password requirements now display before user starts typing
  - Shows all requirements (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - Initially displays with unchecked indicators
  - Updates in real-time as user types
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/pages/AdminUserCreation.tsx`

- **Section Completion Checkmarks**: Organization setup form now shows visual completion status
  - Green checkmarks appear when required fields are filled
  - Red asterisks removed when section is complete
  - Provides instant feedback on form progress
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/pages/OrganizationSetup.tsx`

- **Sticky Continue Button (Mobile)**: Continue button stays visible at bottom on mobile devices
  - Uses responsive Tailwind classes (`sticky bottom-0 md:relative`)
  - Improves UX on long forms by keeping primary action visible
  - Applied to NavigationChoice and OrganizationSetup pages

#### Onboarding Validation Enhancements
- **Inline Address Validation**: Error messages now appear directly under address form fields
  - Previously only showed summary errors at bottom
  - Improves user experience by showing exactly which field has an issue
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/pages/OrganizationSetup.tsx`

- **URL Auto-HTTPS**: Website URLs automatically prepend `https://` if no protocol specified
  - Triggers on blur event
  - Prevents common user error of omitting protocol
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/pages/OrganizationSetup.tsx`

- **Improved ZIP Code Error Message**: Now shows expected format
  - Old: "Invalid ZIP code"
  - New: "Invalid ZIP code format. Expected: 12345 or 12345-6789"

#### Onboarding Progress & Consistency
- **Standardized Progress Indicators**: All onboarding pages now show consistent "Step X of 10"
  - Updated DepartmentInfo, ModuleSelection, NavigationChoice pages
  - Provides clear expectation of onboarding length

- **Enhanced Database Initialization Messaging**: Onboarding check page now explains 1-3 minute startup delay
  - Shows database connection retry attempts during MySQL initialization
  - Displays migration count and progress
  - Explains which tables are being created (users, training, events, elections, inventory, etc.)
  - Provides context for first-time startup delays
  - Location: `frontend/src/modules/onboarding/pages/OnboardingCheck.tsx`

### Removed - Frontend (2026-02-08)

- **Auto-save Notification**: Removed misleading auto-save indicators from OrganizationSetup page
  - Zustand state changes are not true "auto-saves" to backend
  - Prevents user confusion about when data is actually persisted

- **Redundant Session Storage Calls**: Removed unnecessary `sessionStorage` writes in DepartmentInfo
  - Data already persisted via Zustand store with localStorage
  - Simplified state management approach

### Fixed - Backend (2026-02-08)

#### Configuration Errors
- **Fixed Settings Configuration Reference** (`backend/app/utils/startup_validators.py`)
  - Changed `settings.MYSQL_DATABASE` → `settings.DB_NAME` (lines 64, 199)
  - Resolves error: `'Settings' object has no attribute 'MYSQL_DATABASE'`
  - Enum validation now works correctly on startup

#### Migration Errors
- **Fixed Duplicate Migration** (`backend/alembic/versions/20260206_0301_add_missing_training_tables.py`)
  - Migration was creating tables (`skill_evaluations`, `skill_checkoffs`, `shifts`, etc.) already created in migration `20260122_0015`
  - Converted to conditional migration that checks if tables exist before creating
  - Prevents error: `(1050, "Table 'skill_evaluations' already exists")`
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with existing deployments

#### API Errors
- **Fixed Organization Creation Error** (`backend/app/api/v1/onboarding.py`)
  - Endpoint was accessing `data.description` but `OrganizationSetupCreate` schema doesn't have that field
  - Changed `description=data.description` → `description=None` (line 1322)
  - Resolves error: `'OrganizationSetupCreate' object has no attribute 'description'`

### Technical Improvements

#### New Hooks & Utilities
- `useUnsavedChanges(options)`: Warns before leaving page with unsaved changes
- `useFormChanged(currentData, initialData)`: Detects if form data has changed from initial values

#### Migration System
- Improved migration error handling with conditional table creation
- Better backwards compatibility for existing installations

#### State Management
- Cleaned up redundant storage operations
- Improved consistency between Zustand store and backend persistence
