# Deep Eye — Red Team Skill

Goal-driven simulation. Deep Eye = web/API recon and foothold sensor.

## Preconditions

RoE (objectives, crown jewels, no-go, detection expectations), legal auth, OPSEC plan.

## Kill chain (web-heavy)

```
Recon → Initial access (app) → Session/token abuse → Lateral (SSRF/cloud) → Objective
```

| Phase  | Deep Eye                                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Recon  | `enable_recon`, OpenAPI, crawl          |
| Access | Core inject, `file_upload`              |
| Authz  | `idor`, `api_bola_deep`, `jwt_deep`     |
| Pivot  | `ssrf_cloud`, `cloud_misconfig`         |
| Mobile | `mobile.enabled` + Frida/static modules |

```bash
python deep_eye.py -u https://APP --scope-nl "SCOPE" -v --formats json
```

## Purple handoff

| TTP | Deep Eye evidence | Telemetry expected | Gap | Fix |
| --- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --- | --- |

## Rules

Stay in RoE; no third-party pivots; no destructive malware; log for debrief.
