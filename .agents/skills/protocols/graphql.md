# GraphQL Testing

**Trigger condition:** `/graphql`, GraphiQL, `__schema` in body; check `graphql_deep`.

## Overview

GraphQL exposes rich query surface: introspection, batching, IDOR via objects, DoS via depth/aliases.

## Detection

```text
# graphql_deep
python deep_eye.py -u https://target/graphql
```

**Indicators:**

- Introspection data returned
- Batch/alias findings

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Introspection

**Tool:** `graphql_deep`
**What to look for:** `__schema` types listed

### Test 2: Batching / aliases

**Tool:** `graphql_deep`
**What to look for:** Large batch accepted

### Test 3: Authz on objects

1. Query other users' objects by ID
2. Compare with authorized session
3. Document BOLA

## Key Payloads

```
{ __schema { types { name } } }
batch of 50 {__typename}
query with 40 aliases
```

## Tools Available

| Tool     | Command        | Purpose                |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Deep Eye | `graphql_deep` | Introspection/DoS/vars |

## Exploitation (When Vulnerability is Confirmed)

1. Map sensitive fields via introspection
2. Prove unauthorized data read
3. Disable introspection in prod; authz per field

## Common Bypasses

- GET vs POST query
- Persisted query abuse

## Remediation Summary

- Disable introspection in production
- Depth/complexity limits; field authz
