# Election System Security Audit
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Audited By:** Claude Code
**Scope:** Ballot integrity, vote tampering prevention, double-voting protection

---

## Executive Summary

The election system has **good foundational security** with proper authentication, eligibility checks, and anonymous voting implementation. However, there is **1 CRITICAL vulnerability** and several areas for improvement to ensure complete ballot integrity.

**Overall Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH** (due to critical double-voting vulnerability)

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

### 1. **NO DATABASE-LEVEL DOUBLE-VOTING PREVENTION** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Location:** `backend/alembic/versions/20260118_0004_add_election_tables.py` (lines 73-93)

**Issue:**
The `votes` table **lacks a unique constraint** to prevent duplicate votes at the database level. The system only relies on application-level checks in `cast_vote()`, which can be bypassed through:

- **Race conditions:** Two simultaneous vote submissions before the check completes
- **Direct database manipulation:** Malicious admin or SQL injection
- **API bypass:** If application logic fails or is compromised

**Current Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    election_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    candidate_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    voter_id VARCHAR(36) NULL,        -- Nullable for anonymous voting
    voter_hash VARCHAR(64) NULL,      -- For anonymous voting
    position VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    voted_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NULL,
    user_agent VARCHAR(500) NULL
);
-- NO UNIQUE CONSTRAINT!
```

**Risk:**
- User can vote multiple times for the same position
- Ballot stuffing possible through race conditions
- Election results can be manipulated

**Recommended Fix:**
```sql
-- For NON-ANONYMOUS voting elections
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_votes_unique_non_anon
ON votes (election_id, voter_id, position)
WHERE voter_id IS NOT NULL AND position IS NOT NULL;

-- For single-position non-anonymous elections
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_votes_unique_non_anon_single
ON votes (election_id, voter_id)
WHERE voter_id IS NOT NULL AND position IS NULL;

-- For ANONYMOUS voting elections
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_votes_unique_anon
ON votes (election_id, voter_hash, position)
WHERE voter_hash IS NOT NULL AND position IS NOT NULL;

-- For single-position anonymous elections
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_votes_unique_anon_single
ON votes (election_id, voter_hash)
WHERE voter_hash IS NOT NULL AND position IS NULL;
```

**Status:** 🔴 **NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX**

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 2. **Race Condition in vote_eligibility Check**

**Location:** `backend/app/services/election_service.py:203-281`

**Issue:**
The `cast_vote()` method performs two separate database operations:
1. Check if user has already voted (lines 169-174, 233-238)
2. Insert the vote (lines 266-279)

Between these operations, another concurrent vote could be inserted, allowing double voting.

**Current Flow:**
```python
async def cast_vote(...):
    # 1. Check eligibility (SELECT query)
    eligibility = await self.check_voter_eligibility(...)

    # ⚠️ RACE WINDOW: Another request could insert a vote here

    # 2. Insert vote (INSERT query)
    vote = Vote(...)
    self.db.add(vote)
    await self.db.commit()  # ⚠️ No database constraint to catch duplicate
```

**Recommended Fix:**
Use database transactions with proper isolation level + unique constraints from issue #1:

```python
async def cast_vote(...):
    async with self.db.begin():  # Transaction
        # Check eligibility
        eligibility = await self.check_voter_eligibility(...)

        # Insert vote (protected by unique constraint)
        try:
            vote = Vote(...)
            self.db.add(vote)
            await self.db.commit()
        except IntegrityError:
            # Caught by unique constraint
            return None, "You have already voted"
```

**Status:** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Critical issue #1 must be fixed first)

---

### 3. **Voter Hash Salt Storage Risk**

**Location:** `backend/app/models/election.py:124`

**Issue:**
The `voter_anonymity_salt` is stored in the database alongside votes. If the database is compromised, an attacker with:
- The salt (from `elections.voter_anonymity_salt`)
- Known user IDs
- The hashing algorithm

Could de-anonymize all votes by recomputing hashes.

**Current Implementation:**
```python
voter_anonymity_salt = Column(String(64), nullable=True)
# Stored in same database as votes!
```

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (requires database access + knowledge)

**Recommended Mitigations:**
1. **✅ Already Implemented:** Documentation states salt can be destroyed after election closes
2. **Additional:** Store salt in separate encrypted key management system (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
3. **Additional:** Add automatic salt destruction 30 days after election closes

**Status:** 🟡 **ACCEPTABLE** with documented salt destruction policy

---

## 🟢 GOOD SECURITY PRACTICES

### 4. **Strong Anonymous Voting Implementation** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/services/election_service.py:292-308`

**Strengths:**
- Uses HMAC-SHA256 for voter hashing (cryptographically secure)
- Per-election salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- Voter ID is never stored when `anonymous_voting=True`
- Salt can be destroyed to make de-anonymization impossible

```python
def _generate_voter_hash(self, user_id, election_id, salt=""):
    import hmac
    data = f"{user_id}:{election_id}"
    return hmac.new(
        key=salt.encode() if salt else b"",
        msg=data.encode(),
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
    ).hexdigest()
```

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

---

### 5. **Comprehensive Eligibility Checks** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/services/election_service.py:74-201`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Validates election status is `OPEN` (line 99)
- ✅ Checks start/end dates (lines 108-124)
- ✅ Verifies user is in eligible voters list (lines 127-135)
- ✅ Position-specific role checking (lines 155-166)
- ✅ Prevents voting for same position twice (lines 233-234)
- ✅ Enforces `max_votes_per_position` (lines 260-263)

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

---

### 6. **Election Closing Time Enforcement** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/services/election_service.py:310-355`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Results ONLY visible after `end_date` has passed AND status is `CLOSED`
- ✅ Prevents result leaks before voting ends
- ✅ Separates ballot statistics (pre-close) from results (post-close)

```python
current_time = datetime.now()
election_has_closed = current_time > election.end_date

can_view = (
    (election.status == ElectionStatus.CLOSED and election_has_closed)
    or election.results_visible_immediately
)
```

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** (recently fixed)

---

### 7. **Audit Trail Logging** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/models/election.py:252-253`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ IP address logged for each vote
- ✅ User agent logged for forensic analysis
- ✅ Timestamp on all votes
- ✅ Rollback history tracked (line 127)

**Status:** ✅ **GOOD**

---

### 8. **Candidate Validation** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/services/election_service.py:240-257`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Verifies candidate exists and belongs to election
- ✅ Checks candidate accepted nomination (unless write-in)
- ✅ Validates position matches if specified
- ✅ Prevents voting for non-accepted candidates

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

---

### 9. **Voting Token System for Email Ballots** ✅

**Location:** `backend/app/models/election.py:189-226`

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Unique tokens per voter (128-char secure random)
- ✅ Token expiration with `expires_at`
- ✅ Single-use enforcement with `used` flag
- ✅ Access tracking (`access_count`, `first_accessed_at`)
- ✅ Voter hash separation from token

**Status:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**

---

## 🔵 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ENHANCEMENT

### 10. **Add Vote Change Tampering Detection**

**Priority:** LOW

**Recommendation:**
Add cryptographic signature to each vote to detect tampering:

```python
vote_signature = Column(String(128), nullable=True)  # HMAC of vote data

def _sign_vote(self, vote: Vote, secret_key: str) -> str:
    data = f"{vote.election_id}:{vote.candidate_id}:{vote.voter_hash}:{vote.voted_at.isoformat()}"
    return hmac.new(secret_key.encode(), data.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```

**Benefits:**
- Detect if admin tampers with votes in database
- Cryptographically prove vote integrity
- Audit trail verification

---

### 11. **Implement Vote Deletion Prevention**

**Priority:** LOW

**Current:** Votes can be deleted from database by admin

**Recommendation:**
Add soft-delete with audit trail:

```python
deleted_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
deleted_by = Column(String(36), nullable=True)
deletion_reason = Column(Text, nullable=True)
```

**Benefits:**
- Maintain complete audit trail
- Detect fraudulent vote removal
- Enable investigation of deleted votes

---

### 12. **Add Ballot Encryption at Rest**

**Priority:** LOW (if database is already encrypted)

**Recommendation:**
Encrypt candidate_id and voter information:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Encrypt candidate choice before storing
encrypted_candidate_id = Column(String(256), nullable=False)
```

**Benefits:**
- Protection even if database backup is stolen
- Additional layer for anonymity
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## 🔐 CONCLUSION

The election system has a **strong security foundation** with proper authentication, comprehensive eligibility checks, well-implemented anonymous voting, and database-level ballot integrity.

**All critical and high-priority vulnerabilities have been fixed** as of the 2026-02-12 review:
- Database unique constraints prevent double-voting at the DB level
- IntegrityError handling catches race conditions in both authenticated and token-based voting
- Anonymous vote eligibility correctly queries voter_hash instead of voter_id
- Status transitions are properly guarded (no bypass via PATCH)
- Results visibility cannot be toggled during active elections
- Input validation enforces valid voting methods, victory conditions, and candidate positions
- Email templates escape user-supplied data

**Remaining improvements** are medium/low priority: automatic salt destruction, vote signatures, bulk vote atomicity, multi-position token support, and voter-facing UI.

**Audit History:**
- 2026-02-10: Initial audit — Score 7.1/10 (critical double-voting vulnerability)
- 2026-02-10: DB unique constraints added (migration 20260210_0023)
- 2026-02-12: Comprehensive review — 11 fixes applied, Score 9.0/10
