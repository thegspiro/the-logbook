# Alembic Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts for The Logbook.

## Creating a New Migration

```bash
# Auto-generate migration from model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Create empty migration
alembic revision -m "description of changes"
```

## Applying Migrations

```bash
# Upgrade to latest version
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade one version
alembic upgrade +1

# Downgrade one version
alembic downgrade -1

# Show current version
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history
```

## Initial Setup

The first migration creates all tables based on the SQLAlchemy models.

## Notes

- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on a development database first
- Backup production database before applying migrations
- Migrations are stored in alembic/versions/
